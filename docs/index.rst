|bfrescox| Python package
=========================

Let's use some macros such as |bfrescox| and |bfrescoxpro| (|ie| the packages
that we are working with), which is developed as part of |band| |via|
collaboration.

This software could be used to provide different parameterized models of the
general form :math:`f(\invar; \psp)`, where :math:`\invar` represents the
independent, or input, variables; :math:`\psp`, a point in the model's parameter
space :math:`\PS`.  In many cases, the parameter space is :math:`\PS =
\R^{\np}`.

    Add information here about licensing and that users are solely responsible
    for use of software in their research?

.. note::

    This is presently being developed as an alpha version.  While all
    functionality offered officially is under test, the code and test suite are
    still under active development.  In addition, the interface of the package
    will likely undergo significant changes as we work to the first official
    release.
