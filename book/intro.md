# Introduction

[{{frescox}}](https://www.fresco.org.uk) is a reaction code written in Fortran
that is used to calculate nuclear scattering observables and that is widely used
in nuclear reaction theory.  It solves the **coupled-channel** form of the
Schrödinger equation, where different reaction pathways—such as elastic
scattering, inelastic excitation, or transfer—can interact with each other
during a collision.  This book provides examples that demonstrate how the
{{bfrescox}} Python package can be used to run different, common scattering
simulations with {{frescox}}.

A detailed description of the theory behind {{frescox}} can be found in
{cite:t}`Thompson_Nunes_2009`.  For detailed information regarding the
{{bfrescox}} package including the programmatic interface, please refer to the
{{bfrescox}} [User Guide](https://bfrescox.readthedocs.io).
