# Introduction

[{{frescox}}](https://www.fresco.org.uk) is a reaction code used to calculate nuclear scattering observables. It solves the **coupled-channel** form of the Schrödinger equation, where different reaction pathways—such as elastic scattering, inelastic excitation, or transfer—can interact with each other during a collision. {{frescox}} is widely used in nuclear reaction theory. A detailed decription of the theory behind {{frescox}} can be found {cite:t}`Thompson_Nunes_2009`.
