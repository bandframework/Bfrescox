All the code and files in this repository should be generically useful and for
inclusion in any BFrescox Python package that we might create.

In particular, Python code should be written as standalone code that would
function as is.  It should make no reference to an enclosing package or its
assumed contents (e.g., relative imports or paths to files in the package).
