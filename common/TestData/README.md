bfrescox Tests
============================

Elastic Template Tests
----------------------

These tests cover the problem of generating, filling in a template for elastic
scattering problems using `bfrescox.generate_elastic_template`, running bfrescox on 
that problem, and verifying that the results match expected baselines.

__TODO__: Ideally we will have at least two substantially different test
problems for each template.  In addition to this, we might want to run each test
with different combinations of parameter values and different outputs produced.
__TODO__: Fill this in as individual tests are added


Inelastic Template Tests
------------------------
These tests cover the problem of generating, filling in a template for inelastic
scattering problems using `bfrescox.generate_inelastic_template`, running bfrescox on 
that problem, and verifying that the results match expected baselines.
__TODO__: Fill this in as individual tests are added


User Provided Template Tests
----------------------

User provided templates are any otherwise valid FRESCOX namelist input files that have
placeholders for parameters that bfrescox can fill in. These tests cover cases not included 
in the templates that can be generated by bfrescox itself. 

- `48Ca` is elastic scattering of 48Ca on a point target, using a non-local 
  optical potential. The template is provided in the test suite as `TestData/48Ca_Ozge.template`.
